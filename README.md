# 🔐 Caesar Cipher System (Python)

A terminal-based encryption and decryption program implementing the classic Caesar Cipher technique with record storage.

---

## 📌 Project Description

**Caesar Cipher System** is a terminal-based Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher technique. It generates random shift values for encryption and securely stores original text, encrypted text, and shifts in a CSV file using pandas for later decryption and record management.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher  
- 🔓 Decrypt previously encrypted text  
- 🎲 Random shift generation for encryption  
- 💾 Store encryption records in CSV file  
- 📄 View and select stored encrypted records  
- 📟 Menu-driven terminal interface

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- CSV File Handling  
- Random Module  
- String Manipulation  
- Loops & Conditional Logic

## 📊 Data Storage

All encryption records are stored in a CSV file with the following fields:
1. orignaltext
2. encryptedtext
3. shift

This allows accurate decryption and persistent record management
